<h1>Send Emails via API</h1>

	started, make sure to <a href="/docs">set up a project</a>
	and familiarize yourself with the

<h2 id="retrying">Retrying Failed Requests & Idempotency</h2>

<h3>Implement retrying</h3>

<p>
	The HTTP request to send an email may fail due to network issues or other temporary problems. To
	prevent losing emails, we recommend configuring your application to retry automatically if the
	API returns a non-2xx status code with incremental backoff.
</p>

<p>
	The recommended retry strategy is to send emails asynchronously and retry up to 3 times with an
	exponential backoff strategy (e.g., 30s, 2m, 5m). If the request fails after 3 retries, you can
	log the error and notify your team to investigate the issue.
</p>

<p>
	If your setup sends emails synchronously (ex: within a web request), you can still implement
	retrying with smaller timeouts, such as 1s, 2s, and 5s.
</p>

<h3 id="idempotency">Idempotency</h3>

<p>
	When retrying it is possible that your request was already accepted and queued by the API, but
	somehow your application was not able to correctly handle the response (or the response was not
	received due to a network issue). In such cases, you may end up sending the same email multiple
	times. To prevent that, use the <code>X-Idempotency-Key</code> header in your request. This header
	should contain a unique idempotency key for each email you send.
</p>

<p>Some idempotency key examples:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<code>
			welcome-email-{'{userId}'}
		</code> <br />(since the welcome email is sent only once to a user)
	</li>
	<li>
		<code>
			order-confirmation-{'{orderId}'}
		</code> <br />(since the order confirmation email is sent only once for an order). Note that
		you should use a new key if you have a "resend" option for an email.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Idempotency keys are saved for 24 hours. If you retry a request with the same idempotency key
	before the 24-hour period ends, the API will return the same response as the first request
	without actually processing it. If the idempotency key is not found, the API will process the
	request as usual and return a new response.
</p>

<p>
	<code>X-Idempotency-Short-Circuit</code> header is set to <code>true</code> if the response was created
	using a previously processed request with the same idempotency key.
</p>

<h3 id="response-status-codes">Response Status Codes</h3>

<Table columns="1fr 2fr 3fr">
	<TableRow head>
		<div>Code</div>
		<div>Description</div>
		<div>What to do</div>
	</TableRow>
	<TableRow>
		<div>200</div>
		<div>Email queued.</div>
		<div>No action needed.</div>
	</TableRow>
	<TableRow>
		<div>4xx</div>
		<div>Client/request error.</div>
		<div>
			Correct the request and retry with a new idempotency key. Retrying without changing the
			request will not have any effect.
		</div>
	</TableRow>
	<TableRow>
		<div>429</div>
		<div>Too Many Requests.</div>
		<div>
			Retry after the specified <code>Retry-After</code> header value. If you are using an idempotency
			key, you can retry with the same key.
		</div>
	</TableRow>
	<TableRow>
		<div>5xx</div>
		<div>Server error.</div>
		<div>Retry the request with the same idempotency key after a short delay.</div>
	</TableRow>
</Table>

<p>
	If the server returns a 5xx status code, idempotency keys are not saved, and retrying the
	request is recommended. For 4xx status codes, except 429, the idempotency key is saved, and
	retrying the request will not have any effect unless you change the request and use a new
	idempotency key.
</p>

<h2 id="send-status">Send Status</h2>

<p>
	Send status, as in the Console API <a href="/docs/api-console#send-object">Send Object</a>, can
	be one of the following:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<strong>queued</strong> - Hyvor Relay has accepted the request and queued the email for sending.
		It can also mean that the email is re-queued after a temporary failure.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>accepted</strong> - The recipient's email server has accepted the email. The status
		can still change to <code>bounced</code> or <code>complained</code> later.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>bounced</strong> - The recipient's email server has rejected the email. The email will
		not be retried. If this was a hard bounce (5xx SMTP status code), the recipient's email will
		be added to the suppression list, and no further emails will be sent to that address.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>complained</strong> - The recipient has marked the email as spam or complained about
		it, usually after the email was delivered.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	See <a href="/docs/webhooks#send-recipient-accepted">Webhook Send Events</a> for more information
	on each status.
</p>

<h2 id="rate-limit">Rate Limiting</h2>

<p>
	The rate limit for the <code>POST /api/console/sends</code> endpoint is
	<strong>10 requests per second</strong>
	(per project).
</p>

	Learn more about <a href="/docs/api-console#rate-limit">Console API Rate Limiting</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="limits">General Limits</h2>

<ul>
	<li>
		<strong>Recipients</strong> are limited to <strong>20</strong>, including TO, CC, and BCC
		recipients. In Cloud, each recipient is billed as a separate email (ex: if you send an email
		to 3 recipients, you will be billed for 3 emails).
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Total email size</strong> is limited to <strong>10MB</strong>. <br /> (including headers,
		body, and attachments).
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>HTML body size</strong> is limited to <strong>2MB</strong>.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Plain text body size</strong> is limited to <strong>2MB</strong>.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Subject</strong> is limited to <strong>998</strong> characters.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Attachments</strong> are limited to <strong>10</strong> per email. There is no size limit
		for each attachment, but the total email size must not exceed 10MB.
	</li>
	<li id="custom-headers-limit">
		<strong>Custom headers</strong> do not allow the following headers:
		<div>
			{#each unallowedCustomHeaders as header, i}
				<code>{header}</code>{#if i < unallowedCustomHeaders.length - 1},&nbsp;{/if}
			{/each}
		</div>
