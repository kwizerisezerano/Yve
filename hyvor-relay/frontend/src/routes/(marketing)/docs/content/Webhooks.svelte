<h1>Webhooks</h1>

<p>
	Webhooks are a way to receive HTTP POST requests from Hyvor Relay when certain events occur.
	They are useful to sync state (email sending status) between Hyvor Relay and your application or
	to trigger actions in your application based on events in Hyvor Relay.
</p>

</ul>

<h2 id="request-format">Request Format</h2>

<p>
	When an event occurs, Hyvor Relay sends an HTTP <code>POST</code> request to your webhook URL with
	the following headers:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<strong>Content-Type</strong>: <code>application/json</code>
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>X-Signature</strong>: A hex-encoded HMAC-SHA256 signature of the raw request body, signed
		with your webhook's secret. See <a href="#validating">Validating Webhooks</a> for how to verify
		it.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>The JSON body of the request has the following structure:</p>

<CodeBlock
	code={`
{
	"event": "send.recipient.bounced",
	// payload depends on the event
	// see Events & Payloads below
	"payload": {}
}
`}
	language="json"
/>

<h2 id="events">Events & Payloads</h2>

<p>
	Each event below shows the shape of the <code>payload</code> field of the
	<a href="#request-format">request body</a>. The <code>event</code> field is set to the event name
	(e.g. <code>send.recipient.accepted</code>).

<h3 id="send-recipient-accepted">send.recipient.accepted</h3>

<p>
	<code>send.recipient.accepted</code> is triggered when an email is accepted by the recipient
	SMTP server. This can be triggered once for a recipient of a send. It indicates that the email
	has been successfully delivered to the recipient's server, but it does not guarantee that the
	email has been delivered to the recipient's inbox. <code>send.recipient.bounced</code> or
	<code>send.recipient.complained</code> can be triggered later if the email is not delivered to the
	recipient's inbox (ex: when the mailbox is full, or if the email provider's spam detector detects
	the mail as spam) or if the recipient marks it as spam.
</p>

</p>

<h3 id="send-recipient-deferred">send.recipient.deferred</h3>

<p>
	<code>send.recipient.deferred</code> is triggered when an email is temporarily deferred by the
	recipient SMTP server. This can happen for various reasons, such as the recipient's server being
	busy or because of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greylisting_(email)">greylisting</a>.
	Hyvor Relay will retry sending the email a few more times before giving up. You can expect a
	<code>send.recipient.accepted</code>
	or
	<code>send.recipient.bounced</code> event later.
</p>

</p>

<h3 id="send-recipient-bounced">send.recipient.bounced</h3>

<p>
	<code>send.recipient.bounced</code> is triggered when an email is permanently rejected by the recipient
	SMTP server. This can happen for various reasons, such as the recipient's email address not existing
	or the recipient's server rejecting the email due to spam filters.
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<strong> Synchronous Bounces: </strong> In some cases, bounces are detected immediately in
		the SMTP conversation when sending the email. In such cases, the
		<code>send.recipient.bounced</code> event is triggered immediately.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong> Asynchronous Bounces: </strong> In other cases, the bounce is detected later, such
		as when the recipient's server sends a bounce notification (Delivery Status Notification,
		DSN) after some time. In such cases, a <code>send.recipient.accepted</code> event is
		triggered first, followed by the <code>send.recipient.bounced</code> event when the bounce is
		detected.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	If we detect a hard bounce (permanent failure) for a send, the email address is automatically
	added to your project's suppression list. This means that you cannot send emails to that email
	address again unless you manually remove it from the suppression list. This is to prevent
	sending emails to invalid email addresses, which can harm your sender reputation.
</p>

	attempt: SendAttempt | null;

	<a href="/docs/api-console#bounce-object">Bounce</a>
</p>

<h3 id="send-recipient-complained">send.recipient.complained</h3>

<p>
	When a recipient marks an email as spam, the email provider sends a complaint, called a Feedback
	Loop (FBL), to Hyvor Relay. Hyvor Relay is configured to receive FBLs from major email
	providers.bind: We process these complaints and trigger the <code
		>send.recipient.complained</code
	> event. This event indicates that the recipient has marked the email as spam or junk. When this
	event is triggered, the email address is automatically added to your project's suppression list,
	similar to when a hard bounce occurs.
</p>

</p>

<h3 id="send-recipient-suppressed">send.recipient.suppressed</h3>

<p>
	This event is triggered when an email is not sent to a recipient because the recipient was
	previously added to the suppression list. This means that the email was automatically marked as
	suppressed without trying to send it. No further events will be triggered for this recipient.
</p>

</p>

<h3 id="send-recipient-failed">send.recipient.failed</h3>

<p>
	This event is triggered when an email could not be sent to a recipient after multiple attempts
	due to network or server issues. No further events will be triggered for this recipient.
</p>

<p>
	Note: This is different from a bounce. A bounce indicates that the recipient's server rejected
	the email, while a failure indicates that the email could not be sent due to other issues.
	Failed emails are not added to the suppression list automatically.

<h2 id="retrying">Retrying</h2>

<p>
	When Hyvor Relay sends a webhook, it expects a <code>2xx</code> HTTP response code from your
	application. If it does not receive a <code>2xx</code> response, it will retry sending the webhook
	up to 6 times with the following intervals between retries:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>1 minute</li>
	<li>5 minutes</li>
	<li>15 minutes</li>
	<li>1 hour</li>
	<li>4 hours</li>
	<li>24 hours</li>
</ul>

<p>
	If all retries fail, the webhook delivery will be marked as failed, and you can view the
	delivery status in the Hyvor Relay Console, including the error message received from your
	server.
</p>

<h2 id="validating">Validating Webhooks</h2>

<p>
	When creating a webhook, a secret key is generated. This will be used to sign the webhook
	requests. You can then verify the signature of the request to make sure it's coming from Hyvor
	Relay. The signature is a HMAC-SHA256 hash of the request JSON body. The secret key is used as
	the key. To validate, you should generate a signature using the same algorithm, the given
	request body, and the secret key. Then, compare the generated signature with the signature in
	the <code>X-Signature</code> header. If they match, the request is valid.
</p>
