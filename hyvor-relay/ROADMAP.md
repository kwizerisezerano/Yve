Features to implement:

- [ ] Incoming email routing
- [x] Send via SMTP
- [ ] Dedicated IPs for users
- [ ] Custom DKIM selectors

Features we will not implement:

- In-built authentication: Since our Cloud depends on HYVOR authentication from hyvor.com, we do not plan to implement
  an in-built authentication system within Relay. That would be redundant. OpenID Connect will be the only
  authentication method available for self-hosted Relay instances.
- No in-built open or click tracking. It wouldn't be too hard to implement at the app-level.
- Templates.
